# Robotic Arm Project Report

## Overview
This project presents the design, development, and implementation of a robotic arm with five degrees of freedom. The arm is controlled using an Arduino microcontroller and features Bluetooth connectivity for user commands via an Android application. It is designed to replicate human arm functions, offering precise movements and material handling capabilities in industrial and research applications.

## Features
- **Arduino-Controlled**: Utilizes Arduino Uno for microcontroller tasks.
- **Bluetooth Integration**: Commands are transmitted through an Android app using HC-06 Bluetooth module.
- **Five Degrees of Freedom (DOF)**: Achieves versatile movement across X, Y, Z axes.
- **Servo Motors**: High precision with MG996R and SG90 servos for joint actuation.
- **Mechanical Design**: Incorporates counterweights for balance and robust build.
- **Custom Android App**: Developed using MIT App Inventor for seamless user interface.
